# Covid-Tracker
Web application for tracking Covid-19 patients

This project is a web and mobile-based application to digitize the entire life cycle of Covid-19 patients ranging from diagnosis and patient care to recovery and observance of long-term effects, thereby allowing the medical front-liners to effectively and centrally monitor, control, and track this process. Furthermore, our application also provided healthcare officials with detailed analyses of the patterns observed in disease outbreaks and predictions of areas where there was a strong probability of a surge in positive patients (through the usage of unsupervised ML algorithms for geographical clustering).
